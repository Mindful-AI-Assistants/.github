## [What are Copilots, Bots, and Agents?]()

- **Copilots:** A Copilot is an artificial intelligence that assists users in specific tasks, providing real-time suggestions and guidance. For example, a Copilot can be designed to help users write code, providing real-time suggestions and corrections.

- **Bots:** A Bot is a software programmed to perform automated tasks. Bots can be simple (like a customer service bot that answers frequently asked questions)  or complex (like a stock trading bot that analyzes real-time stock market data).

- **Agents:** An Agent is a computer program that operates autonomously to perform specific tasks. They are designed to learn and adapt over time based on data input and feedback. They can be used in a variety of applications, from computer games to virtual personal assistants.
